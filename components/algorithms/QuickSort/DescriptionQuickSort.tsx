        Quick Sort Algorithm
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Quick Sort is a highly efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm
        that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to organize data. Developed
        by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961,
        it remains one of the most widely used sorting algorithms due to its
        average-case performance and in-place sorting capabilities.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800">
        How Quick Sort Works:
      </h3>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Pivot Selection:</strong> Choose an element from the array to
          serve as the pivot. The choice of pivot can significantly affect
          performance; common strategies include selecting the first element,
          the last element, the middle element, or a random element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Partitioning:</strong> Rearrange the array so that elements
          less than the pivot are positioned to its left, and elements greater
          than the pivot are positioned to its right. This step ensures that the
          pivot is in its final sorted position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recursive Sorting:</strong> Recursively apply the same process
          to the sub-arrays formed by dividing at the pivot—one containing
          elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater
          than the pivot.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        This process continues until the base case is reached, where the
        sub-arrays have zero or one element, at which point they are inherently
        sorted.
      </p>

        Performance Characteristics:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Average-Case Time Complexity:</strong> O(n log n), making it
          efficient for large datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Worst-Case Time Complexity:</strong> O(n²), which occurs when
          the smallest or largest element is consistently chosen as the pivot,
          leading to unbalanced partitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(log n) due to the recursive call
          stack, as Quick Sort is typically implemented in-place, requiring
          minimal additional memory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800">Advantages:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Quick Sort is generally faster in
          practice compared to other O(n log n) algorithms like Merge Sort and
          Heap Sort, especially for large datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In-Place Sorting:</strong> It sorts the array without
          requiring additional storage, making it space-efficient.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800">
        Disadvantages:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Unstable Sort:</strong> Quick Sort is not stable; equal
          elements may not retain their original relative order after sorting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Worst-Case Performance:</strong> If not implemented carefully,
          particularly in pivot selection, Quick Sort can degrade to O(n²) time
          complexity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800">
        Optimizations:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Pivot Selection:</strong> Choosing a good pivot is crucial.
          Techniques like the &quot;median-of-three&quot; method, which selects
          the median of the first, middle, and last elements, can help in
          achieving better performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong> Switching to simpler sorting
          algorithms like Insertion Sort for small sub-arrays can improve
          efficiency.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800">Usage:</h3>
